"Girls Clothing","Girls Clothes 3 Piece Outfits Long Sleeve Tracksuit Hoodie Pants Fall Winter Matching Sets","Customer Review","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024","I love this outfit!  I got it for my 10 year old daughter and it‚Äôs so cute on her. She loves it. The material is really nice and soft, and she said it‚Äôs really comfortable. It‚Äôs not like sweatshirt fabric (material is 95% Polyester, 5% Spandex), it‚Äôs a bit different and it‚Äôs lightweight. She‚Äôs really skinny but really tall for her age so I got this in the 11-12 and it fits great. The hoodie is a little short but it‚Äôs supposed to be. This is a great outfit for girls and I highly recommend.",5,NA

"Girls Clothing","Fruit of the Loom Toddler Girls' Toddler Girls' Tag-free Cotton Underwear","BabyChickenMamaDrama","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2024","My almost 6yo daughter is a peanut at only 36 pounds, making it difficult to purchase the proper size clothing for her many times. She just started wearing a 4T these past few months, but many brands in that size are still too big.However, her 4T undies are now starting to get a little small. I wasn't sure exactly what size to get. The weight on the size 4/5T is 33-40 pounds, so since her 36 pound weight is right in the middle, it seemed to be the best choice, as opposed to jumping right up to size 5T, which seemed to be my only other option with other brands.I've bought Fruit of The Loom for her before and know and trust the quality. She potty trained late, and the undies held up through frequent washings and scrubbing out stains so I'm comfortable sticking with the brand, knowing their stability and elasticity will last. These Connecticut summers are very hot and humid, and the lightweight material is very important for her comfort.I'm glad I went with this size. They are a tad big in the bum, so she has room to grow, but they aren't so much that I can tell she has baggy undies when she wore them under cartwheel shorts. While they are Hipsters, as they are bit big now, they fit better pulled up a little, maybe a bit lower than where a brief would sit.The elastics are perfect around her waist and legs. As soon as I showed her the new variety, she immediately picked the floral print, and said how soft they were.Considering these inexpensive these are, they are very good quality. Although I suppose with kids it's not although they are wearing them for years, but the FOTL undies I have I bought for her almost 2 years ago and only now are they starting to get a bit worn out. Not bad at all for a underwear that cost $14 for a dozen pairs.Highly recommended!",5,NA
