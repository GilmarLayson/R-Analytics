"Computers and Tablets","Google Pixel Tablet - Android Tablet with 11-Inch Screen and Extra-Long Battery Life - Hazel - 8 GB RAM - 128 GB","Amazon Customer","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","I bought this to replace a Samsung tablet that had turned into a brick. So far, I am pleased with my purchase.Pros:Good battery life. After watching YouTube for hours and surfing the web, it lasts about a work day. Charges quickly on the docking speaker.USI stylus comparability. Good for Keep Notes note taking, drawing, and as a ""mouse""Pictures and videos are clear.Docking speaker sounds good, and adds depth to music and video sound.Operating software is only about 15 gigs, so far.Easy to set up, and the Google accounts have synced across devices. The calendar widget is awesome!Cons:The cameras are lacking, but at 8 pm I'm not complaining.While drawing (with stylus or with finger) there is a minute lag from touch point on the screen to the drawing portion. I've tried to adjust it, but can't figure out how or if I'm able to.The pull up from the bottom of the screen to close open apps is a little slow, and sometimes doesn't register.This isn't really a con, but is odd: most apps aren't made for tablets, so they show up as a bar/phone like display when in landscape mode. You can move this display from the left, middle or right, and use multiple apps in split screen mode. It does run a little slower then, but isn't a deal breaker for me.Overall:I got this on a lightning deal, and am pleased. I would purchase again if I had to on lightning deal. The Hub screen is not like Nest Hub- it shows media, weather, etc... and is customizable, but doesn't have all of the Nest Hub features. This tablet is a good tablet for media consumption and a little more. Ididn't receive the case I ordered with it, so cannot say anything about that.",5,NA

"Computers and Tablets","Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ Plus 11√¢‚Ç¨¬ù 64GB Android Tablet, Big Screen, Quad Speakers, Upgraded Chipset, Multi Window Display, Slim, Light, Durable, Kids Friendly Design, US Version, 2024, Silver","keeton","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","This is my third Samsung A tablet.  I have found them to be an excellent value for basic use - reading, web surfing, media playback and lightweight games.  I specifically do not use it as a laptop replacement or for hardcore gaming.  The 11"" screen is of an adequate size and the brightness and clarity are perfect for indoor use.  Mine has 128GB storage, which has the more useful upgrade of 8 GB RAM, which makes loading multiple programs much quicker.  There is a SD slot where you can add up to 1 TB, if you require it.The subjective speed of the A9+ is a little quicker than my older A8.  One useful throwback feature is that it has a real headphone jack if you happen to have a quality set of older headphones.  The built-in speakers are better than I would have thought - they are quite clear, but there is still no appreciable bass.Idle time battery life is somewhat less than I would have thought but this unit is still new and I haven't gone through that many charge cycles to sort out what is going on.  If you run the battery pretty far down, it can take a while to charge - about 4 hours from 10% to 100% using a Samsung phone charger.",5,NA

It's a great tablet for the price.  It's hard to even find a smartphone as good as this for that price.  Obviously not as good as the tab S9 or S10, but for $700 less it's worth the trade offs like a lower resolution display.The screen is the high quality one you would expect from a modern Samsung device with rich colors and very bright.The only con is that 4gb of ram in the 64gb model is not enought for multitasking.  You're pretty much limited to 1 app open at a time or it will close the other app when you leave it because there isn't enough ram to have them both open.  Processor is also relatively slow but again, is fine when only 1 app is open at a time and nothing is updating in the background.Rating vs other tablets: 5 out of 10Rating as a sub-$200 tablet: 10 out of 10",5,NA

I had an Alienware laptop before and it was just SO LOUD. And hot. I decided to look for a new laptop within my budget and crossed my fingers that it would actually be good. Well... this computer blew me away with everything I had expected from it. First, it is very lightweight but has a nice, smooth finish to it that feels very durable. The graphics are absolutely incredible and the sound is great. I will definitely like using this laptop whether it be just playing games, watching videos, or writing some poetry! It has all my needs covered. It is also SO QUIET. I am almost in shock at the difference this was compared to the Alienware that was just so much more expensive. The battery life is much better as well. I love the lighting on the keyboard, it just goes with my personality. It's quick, easy to personalize, I really am happy that I bought this computer and not something else. The keyboard is also so much quieter. I won't be waking anyone up while I am up late at night messing around online! I highly recommend this... your money won't be wasted. Good luck and have fun!",5,NA

Keyboard is nice to use.  Screen is bright and crisp.  Laptop is lightweight.This is NOT a laptop for gaming, video editing, demanding graphics work, and you're probably going to get frustrated if you are a busy, multi-tasker with multiple software and dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.That being said, for basic computing needs (word processing, watching Netflix, web browsing, blogging, writing a novel, taking classes, etc...), this laptop is near perfect and budget-friendly.Couple Notes: - The processor is 1.1 ghz, not 2.8 as listed in description, but really, you wouldn't be doing anything on this that should ever require that much processor speed. - Memory is upgradeable, which is nice, but I've found that 4gb is fine for what I'm using it for right now. - Laptop looks stylish, but lacks that ""high-end"" feel - but it's a $200 laptop.  Still, I like it and keyboard feels good for typing at length. - Screen is sharp.  Colors are decent.  Not the best screen out there, of course, but certainly not bad at all.  Not a touch screen...slight bummer but not a big deal to me. - Sound coming from speakers is nice and loud.  No, not premium sound, but sufficient to watch movies/video classes and hear it just fine.  I'm happy with it, but no audiophile.  Use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker if you want better sound. - Performance has been fast and I've been satisfied. - Easy to switch from Windows S to full Windows Home, which is my preference and why I opted for this over a Chromebook. - 81gb of available storage space after OS and apps take up a bit of the 128 gb drive.  To me, that's totally fine since I'm not saving anything on this - it all goes in the cloud. - I don't think the battery will actually last 9 hours with normal settings, but I get a solid 5 or so hours out of it between charges.RE: Slowness/Lagginess:A couple negative reviews mentioned this and when it happened to me, I thought that maybe there WAS something off about this computer.Turns out when I logged into my Microsoft account, it started syncing my existing desktop computer with this laptop, and with only 4gb of memory and slower processor, it just bogged it right down for about 20 minutes or so as it synced apps, desktop icons, etc....  Once everything synced up, it was fine and has been ever since.So if you experience slow, laggy performance when you first get this, and you've logged into your Microsoft account, set it down and let it sync for 20 minutes or so, or better yet, adjust the sync settings to be more selective.All in all, it's a great, inexpensive laptop that is super lightweight, super portable, looks nice, performs great, and is perfect for basic computing, an older child/teen, college courses, etc...",5,NA

Blair","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2023","I got the 15 inch, i needed this mostly for a good laptop, long battery life, USB C Charging, and price. I looked at several ""higher"" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only ""missing"" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true ""lap"" top.Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE.",5,NA
