"Arts and Crafts","Castle Art Supplies 120 Colored Pencils Zipper-Case Set | Quality Soft Core Colored Leads for Adult Artists, Professionals and Colorists | In Neat, Strong Carry-Anywhere Zipper Case","Bethany T.","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","I have quite a few large sets of various brands of colored pencils. I think that overall, this is actually my favorite set! Yes, there are obviously better brands, and these pencils are not in their league, neither for performance nor price!! All things considered, especially the price, that's what makes these my favorite standard colored pencil!! No, these aren't a budget set, and you might even find some pencils that perform more to your liking at a much lower price, it's all just a personal preference, after all.This was the first set of Castle Arts pencils that I bought, over a year ago, and have since purchased the Gold set, the metallic, the pastel ""macaron"" and the water color sets, always the largest quantity available in the zipper pouches. I try not to spend too much on art supplies, but all those other purchases were me chasing the quality of this set.  This particular set is hands down superior to any of the others offered by this brand, but that's just my opinion. I would definitely purchase this again, not totally certain if I would invest again in any of their other sets, but possibly would if I use them all up.These pencils perform comparably to the Crayola brand of colored pencils, except these are a little bit smoother and brighter. This set would be a logical next step-up from Crayolas if you've started there, like their performance, but are looking for something a little bit fancier. To be fair, a lot of people want to complain about Crayola, which I think is just based on their availability at every discount and mass retailer.  I actually use them at times, even with owning tons of other, more desirable sets.  If it's just a coloring book, why burn through professional grade pencils?? These Castle Arts are a great option for coloring books, especially if you opt for them in the zipper case. Very convenient presentation with a sheet to swatch the colors.  My love for this set is honestly based a lot from their presentation and the convenience of the color guide.The pencils come with some instructional info, also.  I love how well these layer and blend. Yes, there's some wax bloom, but you'll get that with any kind of pencil. To compare this set vs. their Gold set, these layer and blend way way better, but the Gold set has more vibrant colors, and sets down more color with less pressure or more color in a single pass. I would recommend these over the Gold set if you're more of a traditionalist with colored pencils and take your time building layers and ranges of tone. These are the best pencils I have found for layering short of some of the higher priced Derwents. To clarify, yes I compared these to Crayola in some aspects, but these layer better than Crayola. The Gold pencils don't let you build the range of subtle layers and effects like these pencils.  The Gold pencils are ""oil"" pencils. All colored pencils have wax binders, but some pencils have added oils, or a somewhat different blend, all subjective, and all depending on the particular brands formulation. I have several different sets of pencils that are labeled as oil pencils, they lay down a lot more color, but they just don't layer and blend quite as well.  Personally, I know of a lot of people who claim they ""hate"" colored pencils, that they just want to color with markers or gel pens because pencils are too soft and light colored.  Of course a lot of coloring books are designed with images on both sides of thin paper, so in that case you're limited to pencils, and if you think you hate pencils, you might want to try oil pencils, like the Gold set.Bottom line, for me this set has been almost the perfect set of pencils.  There's a good range and balance of colors in this set, too.  They sharpen well. I've not had too many issues with poorly blended spotchy nor ""scratchy"" areas like you always get with cheaper pencils. I have had these for over a year, no problems. The case is durable, and also the pencils seem to be a good hardness. They hold a point well.  They're a consistently good product that allows the versatility to use in coloring books, or stand alone art!",5,NA

"Arts and Crafts","Sharpie Creative Paint-like Brush Tip Acrylic Markers, Assorted Colors, Stocking Stuffers, 12 Count, Perfect for Art and Craft Supplies","Midnight Muffins","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024","Just testing these out, they’re already a quick favorite.Love the brush tips, which are surprisingly scarce in the acrylic marker market.The colors are beautiful.And these are OPAQUE. Quickly and easily cover up the other colors for easy layered sketching or fixing mistakes.The paint doesn’t pill, even with a couple layers.Possibly most impressively, they work like a dream on black paper. I’ve had a thin black paper sketchbook (110 gsm) kicking around for quite some time, but hadn’t found a medium I liked to make any use of it.After doodling on some heavy weight white paper and being surprised by how well they performed, I gave them a shot on my black paper sketchbook and I’m in love. Didn’t even damage the super thin paper!Will have to practice a bit more to figure out what works and what doesn’t on the black paper (notice the difference between the white ghost kitty 1st doodle vs unicorn last doodle), I have no doubt a little elbow grease will bring out way better results than what I have pictured.Overall, great product, love them on day 1.If Sharpie *ever* sees this: put out more colors! These shades are gorgeous and I’d love to see more!",5,NA
"Arts and Crafts","Sharpie Creative Paint-like Brush Tip Acrylic Markers, Assorted Colors, Stocking Stuffers, 12 Count, Perfect for Art and Craft Supplies","Midnight Muffins","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024","I LOVE THESE PENS! No nib pumping, no ripping up your paper, lovely brush tips that don't fray. The color palette is small, but versatile. The pens hold a good amount of paint. The paint is reasonably opaque, depending on the color of the surface you're using. I've used them on (thick) paper, wood, plastic, and canvas with great success, and in conjunction with acrylic paint, gel pens, collage, and canvas. They take acrylic varnish very well. Absolutely recommended.Sharpie, can we have more colors and can you sell them singly? Pretty please?",5,NA
"Arts and Crafts","Crayola Clicks Retractable Tip Markers (10ct), Washable Art Marker Set, Coloring Markers for Kids, Stocking Stuffer for Kids, 3+","MHR","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","The Crayola Clicks Retractable Tip Markers have quickly become my go-to choice for all my Toddlers coloring and creative projects. Here’s why they stand out:Firstly, the retractable tip feature is a game-changer. It eliminates the hassle of locating the caps that my toddlers keep losing and keeps the markers fresh and ready to use at all times. This convenience alone makes them ideal for both kids and adults alike.The markers themselves are vibrant and deliver rich, consistent colors with each stroke. Whether its for filling in large areas or adding fine details, the Crayola Clicks markers glide smoothly on paper without smudging or bleeding through.Durability is another strong suit. The sturdy design ensures the markers withstand the wear and tear of frequent use, making them reliable for long-term projects and classroom settings.What I appreciate most is the ergonomic design and comfortable grip. The click mechanism is satisfyingly smooth, and the barrel feels comfortable in hand during extended coloring sessions.These markers offer great quality at a reasonable price point, making them a smart investment for toddlers who are expert at losing caps.Overall, if you’re looking for markers that combine convenience, vibrant color, durability, and ergonomic design, look no further than these markers. They make coloring and creating a breeze while ensuring lasting enjoyment and satisfaction.",5,NA

Per","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024","I purchased these markers for my daughters back to school set. I was getting tired of replacing dried out markers throughout the year so I thought I would give these a try. They are great! The same great washable marker but the click really makes it that much better. My little one would have a hard time putting the marker cap back on fully so we were constantly buying new markers. So far, they are working great for this school year. I would have bought another pack of markers for her normally but this set is still holding strong. Love the click design! Great idea!",5,NA
